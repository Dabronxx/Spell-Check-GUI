# Spell-Check-GUI

GUI program that has 2 text boxes.  The first text box accepts a file to check the spelling.
The second file is the dictionary file or words.  When you click the spell-check button the program opens both files reads
the dictionary file into memory and then spell checks the other file.  To do the spell checking of the other file you should do a binary search on the list of words in the dictionary.  If the word is not in the dictionary file, print it on the screen as a potentially incorrect word.
